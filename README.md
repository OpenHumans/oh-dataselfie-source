# The *Data Selfie* upload project for *Open Humans*

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

This is a Django project that is based on the [23andMe Uploader](https://www.github.com/OpenHumans/oh-23andme-source) (which in turns is based on [Open Humans Data Uploader](https://www.github.com/gedankenstuecke/oh_data_uploader) and [FamilyTreeDNA Uploader](https://www.github.com/gedankenstuecke/ftdna-upload)). It uses the same general logic for setting up the project.
