Thanks for connecting to *Open Humans*. You can now upload your *Data Selfies*.

## How-to
For each file provide:
- A description of the file you're about to upload (What's in the file? When was it sampled? How was the data collected?)
- Give some tags that are keywords describing your data
- Select the file you want to upload
- Optionally: Rinse & Repeat to upload more data.
