Thanks for connecting to *Open Humans*. You can now upload your *VCF* data. Below you can find a simple step-by-step guide to get access to the raw data file that we expect as input.

## How-to

- Select the source (provider/company) that generated your `VCF` file.
- If your data source isn't listed choose other and write a small description.
- Additionally you can give further details on your data set.
- Select your `*.vcf` file (`*.vcf.gz` and `*.vcf.bz2` are fine too)
- Upload the file
