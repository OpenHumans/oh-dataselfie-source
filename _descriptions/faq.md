## Will my data be publicly available?
The short answer: No, by uploading your *VCF* file you don't agree to make your data public or give anyone access to this data. It will be stored in your account and you decide with whom to share.

The longer answer: It can be public if you want it to be public. If you're logged in into *Open Humans&* you can [head to your personal data page, and make individual sources publicly available](https://www.openhumans.org/member/me/data/). If that's too much genome sharing for you, you can also [see if there are individual projects or studies with which you want to share your genome](https://www.openhumans.org/explore-share/).

## Which file formats can I upload?
We accept your genetic variants in [VCF format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format).
This is the most common format for genome & exome sequences and companies like
Full Genomes Corporation, Genos Research, Illumina Understand Your Genome, and Veritas Genetics
offer services to generate these kinds of files.

## Are other file formats okay too?
A regular VCF file should end in `.vcf`. If you have a compressed VCF file that
is either `vcf.gz` or `vcf.bz2`, these will work as well.
Please make sure not not change the format of the file though.
Otherwise the processing on our end will fail
and we will delete the file from your account.

## Can I upload multiple files?
Yes, if you have more than one `VCF` file you can upload multiple files with
this integration.
