## Will my data be publicly available?
The short answer: No, by uploading your *uBiome* data you don't agree to make your data public or give anyone access to this data. It will be stored in your account and you decide with whom to share.

The longer answer: It can be public if you want it to be public. If you're logged in into *Open Humans&* you can [head to your personal data page, and make individual sources publicly available](https://www.openhumans.org/member/me/data/). If that's too much genome sharing for you, you can also [see if there are individual projects or studies with which you want to share your genome](https://www.openhumans.org/explore-share/).

## Which file do I upload?
The main file from *uBiome* are the sequencing reads generated from your microbiome
sample. If you go to [https://explorer.ubiome.com/explore](https://explorer.ubiome.com/explore)
you can find the *Downloads* option under the *Advanced Features* tab.
On that page you will see the `Download Sequence Data` link, which will yield a
`*.zip` file you can then upload to Open Humans. Ideally, you should also give
the content of the `Taxonomy (JSON)` page when uploading your file.

## Can I upload multiple files?
Yes, if you have more than one sample sequenced with *uBiome* you can upload multiple files with
this integration.
