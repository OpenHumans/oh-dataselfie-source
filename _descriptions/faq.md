## Will my data be publicly available?
The short answer: No, by uploading your *uBiome* data you don't agree to make your data public or give anyone access to this data. It will be stored in your account and you decide with whom to share.

The longer answer: It can be public if you want it to be public. If you're logged in into *Open Humans&* you can [head to your personal data page, and make individual sources publicly available](https://www.openhumans.org/member/me/data/). If that's too much genome sharing for you, you can also [see if there are individual projects or studies with which you want to share your genome](https://www.openhumans.org/explore-share/).

## Which files can I upload?
Whatever you want. Lab results, instrument data, and medical imaging, and many more
can be shared with Open Humans through this. We will not perform any processing
of your uploaded files, so make sure they only contain the information you actually
want to upload to *Open Humans*

## Can I upload multiple files?
Yes, you can upload as many data selfies as you want.
