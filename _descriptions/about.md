# Upload your Genome/Exome data to *Open Humans*
If you have had your genome or exome sequenced you can now add this data
to your Open Humans account too. The only requirement for this is that the Data
needs to be in `VCF` format (the most common format to store variants). 

To get started all you have to do is login into *Open Humans*, authorize this
integration and upload your new *VCF* data file.  

Some of your questions should be answered in our FAQ.
